# Week 5 - React

This week, I learned the fundamentals of React.js. In this repository, you should be able to find the work completed this week.
This includes:
- A simple working calculator
- A to-do list

Calculator button sound effects come from [here](https://coloralpha.itch.io/50-menu-interface-sfx)
